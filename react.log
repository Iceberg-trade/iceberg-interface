Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'assert' in '/Users/maqiyuan/iceberg/iceberg-interface/node_modules/circomlibjs/src'
BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "assert": require.resolve("assert/") }'
	- install 'assert'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "assert": false }

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'assert' in '/Users/maqiyuan/iceberg/iceberg-interface/node_modules/circomlibjs/src'

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
	- add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "assert": require.resolve("assert/") }'
	- install 'assert'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
	resolve.fallback: { "assert": false }
